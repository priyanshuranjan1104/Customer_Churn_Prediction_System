# Customer Churn Prediction System (Machine Learning)

## About

The **Customer Churn Prediction System** is a Machine Learning project that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn) or stay. Businesses such as telecom, banking, and subscription platforms can use this system to identify high‑risk customers early and take preventive actions. The project analyzes customer behavioral and demographic data to generate accurate churn predictions and actionable insights.

## 🚀 Overview

Customer retention is significantly cheaper than acquiring new customers. This project builds a predictive model that helps organizations proactively detect customers who may discontinue their services.

The system enables users to:

* Predict churn probability of a customer
* Identify important factors causing churn
* Reduce revenue loss by early intervention
* Support data‑driven business decisions

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load customer dataset
2. Clean and preprocess the data
3. Convert categorical values into numerical format
4. Train machine learning models
5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall and F1‑score
6. Predict whether a new customer will churn or not
